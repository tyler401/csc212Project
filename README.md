<h3> # CSC212 - Final Project Sorting Algorithms</h4>

<strong>Tyler, Cam, Ericsen, Bowen Drawbridge</strong>

> This program will take 1 parameter to run: ./sorting_algorithms
> You will then be prompted to enter a sort type: 'insertion', 'merge', 'quick', or 'heap'
> Then enter the input file from which you will be reading: 'input_file.txt'
> Lastly enter a custom name for the sorted output file: 'output_sort.txt'


<h2> Insertion Sort </h2>
<p>some paragraph about Insertion here</p>

<h2> MergeSort </h2>
<p>some paragraph about MergeSort here</p>

<h2> Quick Sort </h2>
<p>some paragraph about quick Sort here</p>

<h2> Heap Sort </h2>
<p>Heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region.</p>
<p>It does not waste time with a linear-time scan of the unsorted region; rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted region in a heap data structure to more quickly find the largest element in each step</p>
